## NoHitDelay Mod for Minecraft 1.8.9

The NoHitDelay mod is designed to enhance the gameplay experience in Minecraft 1.8.9 by eliminating the hit delay mechanic that is present in the game's combat system. In vanilla Minecraft, when players attack entities, there is a brief cooldown period before they can land another hit. This delay can hinder fast-paced combat and make battles feel less fluid.

### Objectives:
**Enhance Combat Fluidity:** The primary goal of the NoHitDelay mod is to allow players to attack continuously without the restrictions imposed by the cooldown mechanic.

**Improve Gameplay Dynamics:** By removing the hit delay, players can engage in more dynamic and responsive combat scenarios, making battles more exciting and competitive.

**Compatibility:** The mod will be developed to ensure compatibility with existing mods and Minecraft servers, providing a seamless experience for users.

**Technical Approach:** The mod will utilize Minecraft Forge and Mixin technology to modify the game's attack mechanics. By intercepting the attack method and adjusting the cooldown values, we will effectively create a more responsive combat system.

This project is aimed at players who seek a more engaging combat experience in Minecraft and will be developed with an emphasis on stability and performance.
